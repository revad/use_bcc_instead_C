use_bcc_instead_C
-----------------

This is a version of
https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/use-bcc-instead/
updated with the necessary changes up in
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird/Add-ons_Guide_63
and subsequent changes identified during testing

It works with TB 64+
(use_bcc_instead_A worked with TB 60.
 use_bcc_instead_B worked with TB 63.)

ADDON ID
--------

The original author tells me he does not intend to update his original version of this addon.
I have therefore changed the addon name and ID. One effect is that it no longer picks up the description
of the addon, and its use, from addons.thunderbird.net; Refer to the original version if still available.
 
INSTALLATION
------------

Install from addons.thunderbird.net
https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/use-bcc-instead-c/

You can replace 'en-US' with your locale: fr, de, etc
